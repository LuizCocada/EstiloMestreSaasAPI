1) Analyze the best implementation path for employee methods (registration, user relationships, etc.)

2) Refactor the controller and the registrar owner use case. We don't need the user ID in the route parameters,
 we just get it from the token

3) implement the employee methods(only post for now)

4) Validation, use cases and integration tests for all current methods
